How it started
---------------

I developed this Shell because I wanted to learn more about Python, and it's really cool!

Since I made the first version, I never stopped developing. I can't develop it alone so I decided to make it Open Source so every Developer who likes the Idea can help improve it.





Commands
---------------

Right now, there are not that much commands.

But I'm working on it! And maybe the Open 
Source Community can help me!

Requirments
--------------

<ul>
  <li> Python 3.6 and above </li>
  <li> Git</li>
</ul>

Usage
-------

Fire up your terminal and navigate to your desired directory
and run the following commands.

```
https://github.com/Temnly/Slexz.git
```

```
cd slexz
```

```
pip install -r requirments.txt
```
```
python slexz.pyw
```


Now you can run the multiple commands present in this module

#### Happy Hacking!!
