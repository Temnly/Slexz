First of all, you have to install some Modules.
You can install them with typing in the terminal

pip install -r requirments.txt

we always keep the requirments.txt up to date, 
for you so you can install the requirements really easy.
Because we believe, that the users of Slexz don't want to waste to much time on
finding out and installing the missing requirements.

We want Slexz to be a friendly Shell (or Shell Addon) that everyone can use.


We believe in Open Source and not making Profit of our Products.

If you use Slexz or Contribute to it, it makes us very happy, because we can see that the hours we put in pays off.


Ok, that was the Main.txt File. It will introduce you to Slexz.
You can check out the other files, where everything is described. (If not you can write something and contribute or you can contact us to add something)

We will add some new Files every few Months.

So if you are interested in the latest News and Documentation about Slexz, make sure to keep updated right here! :)
