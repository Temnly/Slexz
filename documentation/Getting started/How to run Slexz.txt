In this part of the documentation, we show you how to run Slexz.

If you downloaded Python 3.6 or higher, you have to download the Zip File from Github.
After this you unzip it, and then you navigate to slexz-main
Now some soloution for diffrent Plattforms:


On LINUX you do it like this:

CD to your Directory where slexz-main belongs.

An example: cd /path/to/your/slex-main/

Then you run it like this:

Python3 slexz.py


Then it should work.



For every other OS:

Just go to the slexz-main folder, and double click on slexz.py this should work.
