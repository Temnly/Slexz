In this part, we show you how to write your own commands.
First of all, you need to be experienced in Python.

It's pretty simple, you just need to import all your modules that you need for your command.

Then you do this:
 
write a def general on top, like this:


 def general():
  #here comes your code



This is everything under #here comes your code, you can write your code and you are ready to go.

NOTICE: Don't use a loop in a command, because then it won't stop.


by the way: if you are interested in commiting the command to slexz, it would be really nice :)

Have a nice day!
